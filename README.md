### The Project Is Mainly Bulding to Understand the Core Data Cleaning Process for Large Datasets

#### Some of the Most Important Commands Which I have useded in this Project to Clean The Dataset

1. Identifying the Null Values.

2. Identifying the Duplicate values.

3. Identifying the unstructed Columes and making them into Structed formate.

4. Identifying the Unwanted Columes and Removing from the Table.

5. Making the Rows into the Standedformate.

6. Creating SubQuery to Simplefy the Data and Creating the Columes.

7. Creating the New Tables.
